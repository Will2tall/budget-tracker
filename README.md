# Budget Tracker

## Description

Budget Tracker is a simple website/app that allows you to keep track of spending and deposits.  The selling point is it also comes with offline functionality.
It satisfies my user story of someone wanting to track withdrawals and deposits with or without an internet conneciton so that their account balance is accurate.

## Installation

Using an express server and mongoose database simply run `npm install` in your command prompt in the root directory to install all dependincies.

## Usage

As a simple budget tracker just enter a keyword and value to a purchase, deposit, or withdrawl and the app keeps track of it for you.  If you are offline, it still keeps track of 
everything you need and will notify when you re connect and add the offline info to the database
